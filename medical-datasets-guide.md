## Implementation Examples

### Basic Dataset Loading
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load current project dataset - Alzheimer's research abstracts
alzheimer_dataset = load_dataset("Gaborandi/Alzheimer_pubmed_abstracts")

# Load MedQA dataset
medqa_dataset = load_dataset("bigbio/med_qa", "med_qa_en_source")

# Load PubMed abstracts
pubmed_dataset = load_dataset("pubmed_abstracts")

# Load MedNLI
mednli_dataset = load_dataset("bigbio/mednli", "mednli_bigbio_pe")
```

### Data Preprocessing for Phi

#### Alzheimer's Research Abstracts (Current Project)
```python
def format_alzheimer_abstract(example):
    """Format Alzheimer's research abstracts for Phi instruction tuning"""
    instruction = f"Summarize this Alzheimer's research: {example['title']}"
    response = example['abstract'] if 'abstract' in example else example['text']
    
    full_text = f"Instruction: {instruction}\nResponse: {response}\n\n"
    
    return {
        "text": full_text,
        "instruction": instruction,
        "response": response,
        "title": example['title']
    }

# Apply formatting to current dataset
formatted_alzheimer_dataset = alzheimer_dataset.map(format_alzheimer_abstract)
```

#### Medical Q&A Data
```python
def format_medical_qa(example):
    """Format medical Q&A data for Phi instruction tuning"""
    return {
        "text": f"Question: {example['question']}\nAnswer: {example['answer']}",
        "instruction": example['question'],
        "response": example['answer']
    }

# Apply formatting
formatted_dataset = medqa_dataset.map(format_medical_qa)
```

### Training Configuration

#### For Alzheimer's Research (Current Project)
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="phi4-alzheimer-research",
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,  # Reduced for medical text complexity
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    warmup_steps=100,
    logging_steps=50,
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    eval_steps=100,
    save_steps=500,
    push_to_hub=True,
)
```

#### For General Medical Q&A
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="phi4-medical-qa",
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,  # Reduced for medical text complexity
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    warmup_steps=100,
    logging_steps=50,
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
